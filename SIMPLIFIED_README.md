# Smart Resume Analyzer with AI (Simplified Version)

An AI-powered tool to screen resumes and match candidates to job descriptions efficiently.

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze resumes against job descriptions, providing a compatibility score and actionable feedback. It aims to streamline the initial screening process for recruiters and help candidates tailor their resumes.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares text data using techniques like lowercasing and punctuation removal.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Identifies key terms from resumes and job descriptions using TF-IDF.
- **Semantic Similarity Analysis:** Calculates the contextual similarity between resume and job description.
- **Scoring Mechanism:** Provides an overall compatibility score based on weighted keyword match and semantic similarity.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Generates feedback highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and missing keywords.
- **Streamlit Frontend:** Offers a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Includes Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy containerization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application.
- **Scikit-learn:** For TF-IDF keyword extraction and cosine similarity.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
